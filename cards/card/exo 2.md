## Exercise 2 : Personal Card

With your current knowledge and the tools available to you online, recreate the page shown in Exercise 2.png. Customize the page with your own name, job title, bio and social media links (use the proper icons).

Same as Exercise 1, use the dev best practices.

If you have ant doubt, do not hesitate to ask your teacher or check to documentation online (it's your best buddy I promise).

Tips : you will have to combine two HTML tags to make the icons link to your personal pages ;)
